# text_and_object_recognition
Its the initial version of text and object recognition, this is very restrictive in its function as it is run in a restrictive local environment, with less computing power, the further enhancement of this project can done by converting it into an interactive android app, or even an IoT application where it will help assist a blind person by ecognizing text and object and convey it to the person via speech.
